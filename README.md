# GisMeteo Clone

This project is made by me(Danila) for learning and practicing of frontend development.
I use design of the GisMeteo like a example to my project.
My project is created by the React.js library.
In this project I'm getting weather data using Weather API.

The forecast is provided until 7 days.
