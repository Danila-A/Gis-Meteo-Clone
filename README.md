# GisMeteo Clone

This project is made by me(Danila) for learning and practicing of frontend development.
I use design of the GisMeteo like a example to my project.
For assembly of my project I use **Vite**.
For more comfortable stylizing I use **SASS** extension.
My project is created by the **React.js** library.
To avoid the numerous errors of data processing I use **TypeScript**.
I store global data using **Redux Toolkit** library.
In this project I get weather data using **Weather API**.
I sent http requests via **RTK Query** library.



The forecast is provided until 3 days.
